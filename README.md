Welcome to Shopify Tools, an on-going collection of scripts that can tinker with the Shopify API so that operations for Bot applications be conducted easier. I will be using these scripts as progress for me learning how to write code in Python effectively. Contains all my progress on working with the Shopify API.

# Script Demonstrations
Please see the `../img` directory in this repository for information on script syntax.

# Source Code
All scripts and source code will be pushed inside the `release` directory.

# Required Libraries
* `Python 3.6` or higher
* `requests`

# Introduction
This is a small project for myself so that I can learn Python from the ground up and also learn more about Shopify's API.
