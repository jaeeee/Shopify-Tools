# Shopify-Tools
> Project started and first Python applciation written on: 6/7/19

# Introduction
This is a small project for myself so that I can learn Python from the ground up and also learn more about Shopify's API. Welcome to Shopify Tools, an on-going collection of scripts that can tinker with the Shopify API so that operations for Bot applications be conducted easier. I will be using these scripts as progress for me learning how to write code in Python effectively.

# Completed Tools
* `product_lookup.py` - Allows the user to search a website's full stock information and retrieve product links for all matching records.

# Script Demonstrations
Please see the `../img` directory in this repository for information on script syntax.

# Source Code
All scripts and source code will be pushed inside the `release` directory.

# Required Libraries
* `Python 3.6` or higher
* `requests`
