> Project started and first Python applciation written on: 6/17/19

# Introduction
This is a small project for myself so that I can learn Python from the ground up and also learn more about Shopify's API. Welcome to Shopify Tools, an on-going collection of scripts that can tinker with the Shopify API so that operations for Bot applications be conducted easier. I will be using these scripts as progress for me learning how to write code in Python effectively.

# Tools
* ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `bot.py` instantiates a bot application which facilitates automated purchasing of a certain product 
* ![#c5f015](https://placehold.it/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) `product_lookup.py` allows the user to search a website's product inventory information and retrieve product links for all matching records.
# Script Demonstrations
